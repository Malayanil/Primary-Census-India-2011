  <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
  <br>
  <p>
    This project is an in-depth analysis of the Indian Census, in terms of Population and Variation in work culture. It gives us an idea and an insight on the literacy rates throughout India and State-wise as well. 
  
  It also shows us the variation in work culture in Rural and Urban areas compared along with Gender as a bais factor. Since R has a little issue with Pie Charts, the pie chart depictions has been done with MS Excel.
  
  This project is done by Malayanil Senapati and Shraddha Ghosh.
